"""
Vynix V1 Services Test Suite

Comprehensive P0 tests for the lionagi services layer focusing on critical flaws
and real behavior validation as specified in the TDD documentation.

Test Structure:
- test_executor_reliability.py: CRITICAL ExecutorQueueWaitDeadline flaw validation
- test_executor_lifecycle.py: Structured concurrency and TaskGroup management
- test_executor_rate_limiting.py: Rate limiting accuracy and enforcement
- conftest.py: Shared fixtures, mock services, and test utilities

Key Features:
- pytest-anyio compatibility (asyncio and trio backends)
- Comprehensive mock services for various testing scenarios
- Timing constraints and rate limiting validation
- Structured concurrency leak detection
- Statistical accuracy validation under concurrent load

Critical Tests:
- ExecutorQueueWaitDeadline: Validates deadline-aware waiting in _wait_for_capacity
- StructuredShutdownUnderLoad: Validates proper TaskGroup cleanup
- RateLimitAccuracyAndSafety: Validates thread-safe rate limiting counters
- CancellationPropagation: Validates cancellation through entire stack
